Sets the sequencer port(s) to which the events in the MIDI file(s) are
sent.

A client can be specified by its number, its name, or a prefix of its
name. A port is specified by its number; for port 0 of a client, the
":0" part of the port specification can be omitted.

Multiple ports can be specified to allow playback of MIDI file(s) that
contain events for multiple devices (ports), as specified by "Port
Number" meta events.

For compatibility with
.B pmidi(1),
the port specification is taken from the
.I ALSA_OUTPUT_PORTS
environment variable if none is given on the command line.

.TP
.I \-d, \-\-delay=seconds
Specifies how long to wait after the end of each MIDI file,
to allow the last notes to die away.

.SH BUGS
.B aplaymidi
handles "Port Number" meta events, but not "Port Name" meta events.
